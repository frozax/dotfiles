#  Not all terminals support this and, of those that do,
#  not all provide facilities to test the support, hence
#  the user should decide based on the terminal type.  Most
#  terminals  support the  colours  black,  red,  green,
#  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white, which can be set
#  by name.  In addition. default may be used to set the
#  terminal's default foreground colour.  Abbreviations
#  are allowed; b or bl selects black.
